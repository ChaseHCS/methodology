# Enumeration

This directory holds all of my knowledge pertaining to the enumeration phase. I will be also be putting exploitation techniques in some of the markdown files since it wouldn't make sense to have seperate files in both enumeration AND foothold. IE, Port 21 is essentially just seeing if version of FTP has a cve **OR** try to login with default creds. It wouldn't make sense to have two files for that.
