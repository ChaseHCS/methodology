# methodology
My hacking methodology, written by me NOT robots...

I use this methodology not as a hard set of instructions but more of a compass to follow when I get lost. You will not be able to follow this methodology or ANY methodology blindly to become a penetration tester. The real skills come from getting repetitions and experience (HTB, work experience, etc). Trust me I had to learn that the hard way (Failed OSCP twice). At the very least, hopefully this can help someone out!
