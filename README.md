# methodology
My hacking methodology, written by me **NOT** robots...

I use this methodology not as a hard set of instructions but more of a compass to follow when I get lost. netration tester. During my pentesting I also refer to my `/payloads` and my `/exploit-dev` repos. Hopefully this can help someone out!
